# Accessibility Implementation Plan

This document outlines the accessibility improvements for the Law Firm Dashboard to achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and mobile accessibility.

## Current Issues Identified

### Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Fixed sidebar navigation (264px) doesn't adapt to mobile screens
- [ ] No hamburger menu for mobile navigation
- [ ] Grid layouts may not stack properly on small screens
- [ ] Touch targets may be too small (buttons < 44px)
- [ ] Charts may overflow on small screens

### WCAG Compliance Issues

#### 1. Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] No visible focus indicators on interactive elements
- [ ] Skip navigation link missing
- [ ] Keyboard trap potential in modals
- [ ] Tab order may not be logical

#### 2. Screen Reader Support
- [ ] Missing ARIA labels on icon-only buttons
- [ ] No ARIA landmarks (main, navigation, complementary)
- [ ] Charts lack text alternatives
- [ ] Form fields may lack proper associations
- [ ] Status messages not announced

#### 3. Visual/Color
- [ ] Color contrast needs verification (gold on dark backgrounds)
- [ ] Information conveyed by color alone (trend indicators)
- [ ] Focus indicators may not meet 3:1 contrast ratio

#### 4. Semantic HTML
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy needs verification
- [ ] Button vs link usage needs review
- [ ] Form labels properly associated

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Mobile Responsiveness (Priority: High)

**1.1 Responsive Navigation**
- Implement hamburger menu for mobile (< 768px)
- Convert sidebar to slide-out drawer on mobile
- Add overlay when mobile menu is open
- Ensure touch targets are minimum 44x44px

**1.2 Responsive Layouts**
- Make grid layouts stack on mobile
- Ensure charts are responsive and scrollable
- Add horizontal scroll for tables on mobile
- Test all breakpoints (320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)

**1.3 Mobile Forms**
- Full-width inputs on mobile
- Larger touch targets for selects/buttons
- Proper mobile keyboard types (email, tel, number)

### Phase 2: WCAG AA Compliance (Priority: High)

**2.1 Keyboard Navigation**
- Add skip navigation link ("Skip to main content")
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Add visible focus indicators (2px solid gold outline)
- Implement focus trap in modals
- Logical tab order throughout

**2.2 ARIA and Semantic HTML**
- Add ARIA landmarks: `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`
- Add ARIA labels to icon-only buttons
- Implement `aria-live` regions for status updates
- Add `role="navigation"` and `aria-label` to nav
- Chart containers need `role="img"` and `aria-label`

**2.3 Screen Reader Support**
- Add visually hidden text for context
- Announce form errors with `aria-describedby`
- Add loading states with `aria-busy`
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Alt text for logo images

**2.4 Color Contrast**
- Verify all text meets 4.5:1 ratio
- Large text (18px+) meets 3:1 ratio
- UI components meet 3:1 ratio
- Don't rely on color alone for information
- Add text/icons alongside color indicators

**2.5 Forms Accessibility**
- All inputs have associated labels
- Error messages linked with `aria-describedby`
- Required fields marked with `aria-required`
- Validation errors clearly announced
- Proper input types (email, tel, date)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Accessibility (Priority: Medium)

**3.1 Advanced Features**
- Reduced motion support (`prefers-reduced-motion`)
- Dark mode respects system preferences
- Respect `prefers-contrast` for high contrast mode
- Text scaling up to 200% without loss of content

**3.2 Testing**
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver)
- Mobile device testing (iOS/Android)
- Automated testing with axe-core or Lighthouse
- Color contrast analyzer

## Success Criteria

### Mobile (All must pass)
- ✓ Fully functional on 320px width
- ✓ Navigation accessible on touch devices
- ✓ All touch targets ≥ 44x44px
- ✓ No horizontal scrolling (except tables)
- ✓ Readable text without zooming

### WCAG 2.1 AA (All must pass)
- ✓ All functionality available via keyboard
- ✓ Color contrast ratios meet requirements
- ✓ No keyboard traps

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] Screen reader (3 different readers)
- [ ] Mobile devices (iOS and Android)
- [ ] Zoom to 200%
- [ ] Disable JavaScript
- [ ] High contrast mode
